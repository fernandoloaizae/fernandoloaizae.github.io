I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Life-Cycle Decisions unit of the Munich Center for the Economics of Aging at the Max Plank Institute for Social Law and Social Policy.

My primary research interests are Economic Growth, Wealth and Income Inequality, Human Capital and Life-Cycle Decisions. In my current research, I combine theoretical and empirical models to understand the effects of human capital investments and the economy. My motivation is to understand the main drivers of economic inequality and propose policies to increase economic mobility and achieve sustainable and inclusive growth.
