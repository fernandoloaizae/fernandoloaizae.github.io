This paper investigates the effects of extending the right of self-defense beyond private property on crime-related outcomes. In 2005, Florida became the first U.S. state to introduce the Stand Your Ground Law, which grants individuals the right to use reasonable, including deadly, force to protect themselves in any place where they have a legal right to be. Since then, twenty-four other states have adopted similar laws. By analyzing the staggered implementation of the Stand Your Ground law across counties, we use a difference-in-differences approach to identify the consequences of the law's introduction. Our estimates reveal that states, where the law was implemented, have experienced an increase in the homicide rate. Through examination of various mechanisms, we posit that this rise in crime is driven by hate crime bias or racial bias. In conclusion, these findings provide quantitative evidence against the notion that extending the "no-duty to retreat" beyond private property leads to a safer society.
