Economic discussions about inequality tend to focus on wages. Who earns more, who earns less, and how incomes evolve over time. But this focus misses a deeper divide—one that separates households who rely almost entirely on paychecks from those who increasingly live off portfolios.

Recent evidence suggests that education is the key factor determining whether households ever make that transition.

Looking across U.S. households over several decades, a consistent pattern emerges: education shapes not only how much people earn, but whether they gain access to the financial assets that generate income beyond wages.

## Two paths through the income distribution

For much of the population, income remains tightly linked to labor. Middle-wealth households rely overwhelmingly on wages, with little change in income composition over time. Even as earnings grow modestly, their exposure to capital income—such as dividends, business income, or capital gains—remains limited.

At the top of the wealth distribution, the picture looks very different. Wages still matter, but they are complemented—and increasingly overshadowed—by income from financial assets and businesses. This is not just a story of higher income levels; it is a story of different income structures.

The crucial question, then, is: what determines who moves from one path to the other?

## Education and the accumulation of financial assets

The answer becomes clearer when we look at asset accumulation by educational attainment.

Households without a college degree show relatively flat trajectories in financial assets over time. Transaction accounts grow slowly, retirement savings remain modest, and stock holdings are limited and volatile. For many, meaningful participation in financial markets never materializes.

By contrast, households with college education—and especially those with postgraduate education—exhibit a very different pattern. Over the life cycle, they accumulate substantially more in retirement accounts, pooled investment funds, and stocks. These assets grow not only in level, but in importance within the household balance sheet.

This divergence matters because assets are the gateway to non-wage income. Without retirement accounts, investment funds, or stocks, households remain dependent on labor income alone. With them, they gain access to returns that compound over time.

## From earning income to owning income

Education appears to facilitate the shift from “earning income” to “owning income” through several channels.

First, education increases exposure to financial institutions. Navigating retirement systems, investment products, and tax-advantaged accounts requires familiarity with complex rules and long-term planning—capabilities that are unevenly distributed across education groups.

Second, education shapes financial behavior and risk tolerance. Holding stocks or investment funds involves uncertainty and delayed rewards. More educated individuals are more likely to engage with these assets, not necessarily because they are inherently wealthier, but because they face lower informational and behavioral barriers.

Third, education affects timing. College-educated individuals tend to enter asset markets earlier in adulthood, allowing compounding returns to work in their favor over decades. Those who never enter—or enter late—cannot easily catch up, even if their wages rise later in life.

Over time, these differences accumulate. What begins as a gap in participation becomes a gap in wealth—and eventually, a gap in income sources.

## Why this transition matters for inequality

This transition from paychecks to portfolios helps explain why wealth inequality persists, even in periods of economic growth.

When growth is driven primarily by capital markets, households without assets benefit only indirectly. Wage gains, while important, do not generate the same long-run returns as capital income. As a result, households that remain wage-dependent fall behind relative to those whose income increasingly comes from assets.

Education sits at the center of this process. By shaping access to financial assets, education influences who participates in the mechanisms that drive long-run wealth accumulation.

This perspective also helps explain why policies focused exclusively on wages often have limited effects on wealth inequality. Income mobility does not automatically translate into asset mobility.

## Implications beyond the labor market

Seen through this lens, education policy extends far beyond the labor market.

Education determines whether households can move into asset-based income streams that provide resilience against shocks, support retirement security, and generate intergenerational wealth. Without this transition, even stable employment may not be enough to ensure long-term financial security.

This does not mean that everyone should hold risky assets, or that education alone can eliminate inequality. Family background, institutions, and market conditions still matter. But the evidence suggests that education is one of the most powerful and scalable levers shaping access to asset-based income.

## The takeaway

The divide between households is not just about how much they earn—it is about whether they ever move beyond earnings alone.

Education plays a decisive role in that transition. By shaping access to financial assets, it determines who remains dependent on paychecks and who builds portfolios that generate income over time.

If the goal is inclusive and resilient growth, understanding how education enables this shift—from wages to wealth—is essential.
