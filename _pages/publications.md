This study investigates the causal relationship between education and wealth accumulation. Utilizing three distinct identification strategies, the research analyzes a panel dataset from the United States, encompassing two generations, to explore the dynamics of this relationship. The empirical findings indicate that higher educational attainment, particularly at the college and postgraduate levels, leads to a significant increase in lifetime wealth. This effect varies based on an individual's life stage, their position within the wealth distribution, and the level of education attained. Subsequently, the paper develops a life-cycle heterogeneous agents model to assess the impact of educational policies on wealth accumulation. Calibrated using U.S. data, this model focuses on policies aimed at enhancing the quality and quantity of higher education. The analysis reveals that increasing the proportion of college-educated individuals could potentially reduce wealth inequality. This study contributes to the understanding of education as a relevant factor in wealth generation and distribution.

<div id="CH3" style="display:none; margin-top: 8px;">
This research explores the impact of education on individuals’ involvement with financial assets such as savings, annuities/IRAs, and stocks in the United States throughout their lifetimes. Utilizing panel data and various identification strategies, the findings indicate that education leads to greater investment in these assets, although the extent varies depending on the individual’s life stage and level of education. The paper examines how higher incomes resulting from better education, improved financial behaviors, and an increased willingness to take risks due to educational attainment contribute to these outcomes. While all three factors are influential, the impact of education is moderated by variables such as parental wealth and inheritance. This research suggests that increasing education could help more people invest wisely and increase their financial stability. It provides insights into the relationship between education and financial management, highlighting potential avenues for enabling more individuals to benefit from financial assets.

<div id="CH4" style="display:none; margin-top: 8px;">
This study examines the impact of education on wealth by gender, race, and generation in the U.S., utilizing different identification strategies. This research reveals that the benefits of higher levels of education vary significantly: males and White individuals experience more pronounced gains compared to females and Non-White groups, highlighting disparities in economic returns. Further analysis into generational effects uncovers that the advantages of higher education diminish over time for all groups, with the youngest cohorts facing the least economic benefit. This generational decline calls for a deeper understanding of the evolving role of education in wealth accumulation, stressing the importance of developing policy interventions that address the diverse impacts of education across different demographic segments and over time.

### The Right of Self-Defense: Who is a Threat?

</div>
<div id="SYGL" style="display:none; margin-top: 8px;">
This paper investigates the impact of Stand Your Ground laws, which extend self-defense rights beyond private property, on various crime-related outcomes. Initiated by Florida in 2005, these laws now exist in twenty-five U.S. states, allowing individuals to use reasonable force, including deadly force, in self-defense in any location legally occupied. Our analysis uncovers significant consequences by utilizing a generalized difference-in-differences methodology to assess the staggered enactment of SYG laws across counties. We find that the adoption of SYG laws increases racial and justifiable homicide rates, as well as hate crime incidents. These results challenge the idea that broadening the scope of self-defense laws will increase public safety by deterring crime. Instead, it might increase discriminatory violence and societal divisions.

Macroeconomic Implications of the Care Wave

<div id="bbf-abstract" style="display:none; margin-top: 8px;">
This document describes the construction of an overlapping generations (OLG) model that projects the macroeconomic implications of the major demographic changes happening in Europe in the 21st century, with a focus on two key trends: the retirement of the 'baby boomer' generation and the increasing need for long-term care (LTC). As the 'baby boomers' retire, significant changes are happening in European societies, especially in how pensions are handled and the growing demand for LTC. This research examines the economic and social effects of these changes, putting a spotlight on how an aging population interacts with labor supply and social inequalities. The model includes features such as heterogeneity of health and the resulting provision of care. The hypotheses this research investigates are that these demographic changes, especially the rising need for LTC, will slow down economic growth in Europe and that the increasing cost of LTC will hit lowerincome families harder, making social inequalities worse, and affecting the labor supply of women. By using a detailed OLG model that will be calibrated to represent continental Europe, we aim to show the trade-offs between financial stability, social welfare, and fairness across generations in the face of Europe's changing demographics. The model’s results are meant to help policymakers find a balance between meeting the needs of an aging population and maintaining the overall economic and social health of European societies.
