I am a Senior Research Fellow in Economics at the [Net Zero Lab](https://www.netzerolab.science/) in the [Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition](https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/).

I am an applied economist with an interest in Public Economics. My motivation is to analyze and develop economic policies that foster economic equality, reduce poverty, and enhance social mobility. 

Currently, my research focuses on evaluating environmental policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions. This work further examines how government policies drive climate technology innovation and strengthen carbon markets. In the coming years, I aim to explore how emerging technologies and environmental policies intersect with economic inequality and environmental sustainability.

Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to discuss my research or share insights about yours!
