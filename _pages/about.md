I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Economics in the Life-Cycle Decisions unit at the Munich Research Institute for the Economics of Aging and SHARE Analyses. I also serve as a guest researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Social Law and Social Policy.

At the core of my academic pursuits are Wealth and Income Inequality, Social Mobility, and Human Capital and Health investments. My motivation is to understand the main drivers of economic inequality and advocate for policies that foster economic equality, alleviate poverty, and enhance social mobility.

I am on the 2023-2024 economics job market. I would be delighted to speak with you about my research. You can download my job market paper here.
