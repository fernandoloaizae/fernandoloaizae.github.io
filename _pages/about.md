I am a Senior Research Fellow in Economics at the [Net Zero Lab](https://www.netzerolab.science/) in the [Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition](https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/).

I am an applied economist with an interest in Public Economics. My motivation is to analyze and develop economic policies that foster economic equality, enhance social mobility, and promote environmental sustainability. My current research focuses on evaluating environmental and green industrial policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions, exploring their role in reducing carbon emissions, fostering climate technology innovation, and strengthening carbon markets. In the coming years, I aim to investigate how emerging technologies and environmental policies intersect with economic inequality and environmental sustainability.

Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to discuss my research or share insights about yours!
