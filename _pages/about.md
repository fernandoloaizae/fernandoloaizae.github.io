I am a Senior Research Fellow in Economics at the Net Zero Lab in the [Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition](https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/).

I am an applied economist with an interest in Public Economics. My motivation is to identify and analyze economic policies that foster economic equality, reduce poverty, and enhance social mobility. Currently, my research focuses on evaluating environmental policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions.
