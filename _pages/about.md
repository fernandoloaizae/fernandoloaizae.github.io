I am a Senior Research Fellow in Economics at the [Net Zero Lab](https://www.netzerolab.science/) in the [Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition](https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/).

I am an applied economist with an interest in Public Policy. My motivation is to analyze and develop economic policies that foster economic equality and promote environmental sustainability. Currently, my research focuses on Green Industrial Policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions and fostering climate technology innovation. 

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss my research or share insights about yours!
