I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Life-Cycle Decisions unit of the Max Planck Institute for Social Law and Social Policy. In my current research, I combine theoretical and empirical models to understand the individual and aggregate effects of long-term care needs and evaluate policy interventions related to the economics of aging.

My primary research interests are Economic Growth, Wealth and Income Inequality, Human Capital, and Life-Cycle Decisions. My motivation is to understand the main drivers of economic inequality and propose and evaluate policies to increase economic mobility, reduce poverty and achieve sustainable and inclusive growth.
