I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Economics in the Life-Cycle Decisions unit at the Munich Research Institute for the Economics of Aging and SHARE Analyses. I also serve as a guest researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Social Law and Social Policy.

In my current research, I am dedicated to exploring both the individual and aggregate impacts of long-term care needs and social security systems. My focus extends to evaluating a variety of policy interventions in health, family support, and labor market dynamics, all within the context of the economics of aging.

At the core of my academic pursuits are Wealth and Income Inequality, Social Mobility, and Human Capital and Health investments. My motivation is to understand the main drivers of economic inequality and advocate policies that foster economic equality, alleviate poverty, and enhance social mobility.
