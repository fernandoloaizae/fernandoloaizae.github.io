I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Life-Cycle Decisions unit of the Max Planck Institute for Social Law and Social Policy. In my current research, I combine theoretical and empirical models to understand the individual and aggregate effects of long-term care needs and evaluate policy interventions related to the economics of aging.

My primary research interests are Economic Growth, Wealth and Income Inequality, Human Capital, and Life-Cycle Decisions. My motivation is to understand the main drivers of economic inequality and propose and evaluate policies to increase economic mobility, reduce poverty and achieve sustainable and inclusive growth.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. 

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
