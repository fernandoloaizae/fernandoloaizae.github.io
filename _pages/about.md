I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Life-Cycle Decisions unit at the Munich Research Institute for the Economics of Aging and SHARE Analyses.

My primary research interests are Economic Growth, Wealth and Income Inequality, Human Capital and Life-Cycle Decisions. In my current research, I combine theoretical and empirical models to understand the life-cycle effects of long-term care needs. My motivation is to understand the main drivers of economic inequality and propose policies to increase economic mobility and achieve sustainable and inclusive growth.
