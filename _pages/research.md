## Economics Inequality <a name="bto">&nbsp;</a>
<table style="width:80%"><tr><td>
The <a href="http://www.bto.org">British Trust for Ornithology</a> combines professional field ornithology and a network of over 60,000 volunteers to monitor change in the environment. I am part of the scientific team analysing these rich datasets which deliver the information used to plan and assess conservation action, and to inform decision-making processes for the benefits of society, wildlife and the natural world. I am also involved in research towards new and improved statistical methods for citizen science data sets.
